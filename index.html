 <h2 id="current">Projects Currently in Progress</h2>
 <p>As you can see, this website is one of my projects currently in progress.</p>

 <h2 id="complete">Completed Projects</h2>
 <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.hespta.org" target="_blank">Hammond Elementary School PTA Website</a>:
        Redesigned the full website in August 2020 to improve ease of use.  Continue to maintain and update the website as needed.

 <h1>Bio</h1> 
 <p>In the spring of 2019, I decided to change career directions and become a programmer.  
    I spent several months taking online courses trying to narrow down what I wanted to do.  
    After taking several HTML/CSS courses, I muddled through the design and development of my first 
    website.  I learned a LOT, including how much I <em>didn't</em> know, but I also enjoyed it tremendously.  
    I decided to continue expanding my learning to include JavaScript, and I'm currently working my way through the 
    Full-Stack Developer Path at Codecademy, which I hope to complete in the Spring of 2021.
</p>
<p>
    When I leave my laptop, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, camping, and biking.  
    I train and teach at an all-female karate dojo, where I am working towards my black belt.
    The geek in me loves to assemble puzzles (Star Wars Photomosaics are my favorite challenge), solve word and math puzzles/games, and read.  
    I also enjoy knitting and crocheting to relax.
